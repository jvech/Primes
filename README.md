# Prime number generator

This is just a naive prime number generator
## Usage

```sh
prime <integer>
$ prime 3
5
```

## Instalation
If for some reason you want to use this just download this repository with git
and use __make__ to install it
```sh
git clone
cd Primes/
make install
```

You should make sure that _~/.local/bin/_ path is set in the $PATH variable, if
it is not the case put this in the .bash\_profile file:

```
PATH=$PATH:~/.local/bin/
```


## ToDo

* Add pipe functionality
